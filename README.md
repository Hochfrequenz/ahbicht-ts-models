# ahbicht-ts-models

This repository contains the NPM package [`ahbicht-ts-models`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ahbicht-ts-models).
The package contains the [AHBicht](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/ahbicht) data model as TypeScript classes.

The files in [src](src/) are autogenerated from [JSON Schemas](https://github.com/Hochfrequenz/ahbicht/tree/main/json_schemas), so they're inherently consistent with the AHBicht Python code.
